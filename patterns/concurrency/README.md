# Explanation
The Worker Pool pattern is a concurrency design pattern used to achieve efficient parallel processing. It involves creating a fixed number of worker goroutines for processing tasks concurrently. Tasks are submitted to a channel, and each worker goroutine reads from that channel and processes the tasks. This pattern helps in managing resources effectively by limiting the number of concurrent operations, reducing overhead from constantly creating and destroying goroutines, and providing a straightforward way to distribute work across multiple CPU cores.

### Components
Worker Pool: A pool of worker goroutines that execute tasks.
Task Channel: A channel from which workers receive tasks to process.
Results Channel: (Optional) A channel to collect the outcomes of the processed tasks.
Tasks: Units of work that need to be executed concurrently.
