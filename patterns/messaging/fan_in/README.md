# Explanation
The Fan-In pattern is a messaging design pattern used in concurrent programming to combine multiple input channels into a single output channel. It's particularly useful when you have several concurrent processes producing results and you want to consume all these results in a single process or channel. This pattern simplifies the management of multiple input sources by consolidating their output, making it easier to process or monitor.

In Go, channels and goroutines are commonly used to implement the Fan-In pattern. The key idea is to start a new goroutine that reads from multiple input channels and sends the data read from any of them to a single output channel. This goroutine acts as a multiplexer.
