## Explanation
The Fan-Out pattern in concurrent programming is a messaging design pattern where a single input source is distributed across multiple workers to do concurrent processing. This pattern is beneficial when you want to parallelize processing to increase throughput and reduce processing time. Each worker in the fan-out pattern works independently on the portion of the work assigned to it. When combined with the Fan-In pattern, it can create a powerful system for processing data in parallel and then aggregating the results.

In Go, this pattern can be efficiently implemented using goroutines and channels, allowing you to distribute tasks among multiple workers for concurrent execution.
