# Explanation
The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It's used for creating a publish-subscribe model, where the subject sends updates to its observers when its state changes. This pattern is widely used in implementing distributed event handling systems, in model-view-controller (MVC) architectures, and for facilitating a reactive programming style.

## Key Components
Subject: Maintains a list of observers, facilitates adding or removing observers, and notifies them of changes.
Observer: Defines an updating interface for objects that should be notified of changes in a subject.
ConcreteSubject: Stores state of interest to ConcreteObserver objects, sends a notification to its observers when its state changes.
ConcreteObserver: Maintains a reference to a ConcreteSubject, implements the Observer updating interface to keep its state consistent with the subject's.
